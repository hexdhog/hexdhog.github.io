Actually, I learned basic C programming by playing in Arduino IDE. So I have a decent understanding of how to write basic programs that run on Arduino-like compatible microcontrollers; but I have a mediocre understanding of what is actually going on when I use the Arduino or, even, the own chip&amp;rsquo;s framework. So I want to go down the software stack and understand exactly what really happens under the hood. I think making an LED blink, an extremely basic task, in assembly and without any libraries/frameworks is a decent starting point.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
